# Data Analytics Portfolio

### By Harry Richards

Here is a collection of my data analytics projects. This portfolio will be updated regularly, whenever I make something new that I want to share, it will be shared here.

## Google Sheets Stock Dashboard

In this project, I challenged myself in Google Sheets to create a dashboard for visualising real world stock data. I learned a lot while creating this about custom formats, used namely in the headers so that the numbers are changeable, and the user can change the number of days themselves and the data will auto update to display that. Here is [the link to the google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FvfEuZXPJ8EmkruxwMHnCjTKiZhjf9Mi74hhHRj3Q_Y/edit?usp=sharing).

## SQL Deforestation Project 

In this project, I used SQL and Python to investigate deforestation's affects different areas. My main findings were that 'example'. Here is [the link to the repository](https://github.com/hrichards098/sql-deforestation-project).

In my Python work, I used the libraries; `random`, `itertools`, and `functools`.
